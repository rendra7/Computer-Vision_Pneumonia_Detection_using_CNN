# Computer-vision-X-ray-paru-paru

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can distinguish between normal lung images and those affected by pneumonia. The model uses a dataset of lung X-ray images to detect health conditions, focusing on binary classification (lung normal vs lung affected by pneumonia). The ultimate goal is to develop the best model that assists in the early detection of pneumonia with high accuracy. On this project, the best model I achieved reached an accuracy of 89%.
